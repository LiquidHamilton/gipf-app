I need to update this.

For now, if you want to run it, follow these steps:

1. Open two terminal windows.
2. In the first, navigate to the backend folder and source /venv/bin/activate
3. Launch main.py with the command 'python main.py'
4. Navigate to the frontend folder in the second terminal window.
5. Launch the frontend with the command 'npm start'
6. The game should automatically launch in your web browser. If not, navigate to localhost:3000

You will have 3 logs:
1. frontend log in terminal
2. Backend log in terminal
3. Browser log to console in the dev window of your browser.
